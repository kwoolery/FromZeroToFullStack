## 1.3 What This Book is Not

This book is not a deep dive into any of the individual technologies. There are plenty of great resources that are much more complete in the treatment of the technology as a whole, and I'll list some in the  As stated in the previous section, this book is a guide for developers to find their way from an idea to a fully functional application addressing all the details at the various layers. It's beyond the scope of this book to address some of the nuances of a particular language or framework without losing site of the original goal to build an application. 

As with any project, there are many choices that can be made, and there are many considerations before letting an application into the wild. When I'm able to, I'll address known concerns with regard to security, and scalability, but I don't confess to address every possible issue that a developer can face during a standard Software Development Life Cycle. There are some things that you can read about, and there are common solutions, and then there are some issues that you may not know exist until you are in production. My goal is to give you the confidence to be able to understand how all the pieces work together well enough to find, and fix any issues as they come up.

My advice to any developer seriously considering building this project is to treat the contents of this book as a guide to an advanced MVP for our application, not as a be-all, end-all for everything you may or may not encounter along the way. I'm happy to discuss any errata in the book, and any best practices for future versions. You can reach me at kevin@truvu.ai.
