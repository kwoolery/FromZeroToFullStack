## 2.1 Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is an lightweight code editor produced by Microsoft, and released in 2015 for Windows, Linux, and macOS. It's a highly customizable environment with plugins for virtually all programming, and markup languages. It supports syntax highlighting, code completion, debugging, and source control with Git, which we will discuss in the next chapter. It also has an integrated terminal from executing programs and scripts from the command line.

There is no requirement to use Visual Studio Code to build the project described in this book, however some references will be made to Visual Studio Code throughout the book. The principal thing to remember is that the choice of a development environment is an important one for any developer. When efficiency, and productivity are paramount, it's critical to be comfortable in your workspace, and not have to context switch between disparate tools. Visual Studio Code isn't the only available editor, there are many great options in the market, such as Atom, Sublime Text 2, the Jetbrains Suite, including GoLand, and WebStorm. My advice would be to choose an development environment, and familiarize yourself with the features that will make you the most productive.

I'll describe the installation process, customization, and plugins necessary to create the Visual Studion Code environment that will help us build the project in the most efficient way possible. 

### 3.1.1 Installation

Download the appropriate installer for your operating systemfrom https://code.visualstudio.com/Download and follow the instructions to install Visual Studio Code.

For Mac, you unzip the downloaded file, and drag the Visual Studio Code application directly into the Applications folder. 

For Windows, you double-click on the downloaded VSCodeUserSetup file, and follow the installation wizard instructions. Typically, the default options should work for most people.

For Ubuntu, or Debian, there are multiple ways to install the downloaded deb file. 

* From the directoy you downloaded the file to, run the following commands, for example, if the file you downloaded is called code_1.27.2-1536736588_amd64.deb, the you can run:

```bash
    sudo dpkg -i ./code_1.27.2-1536736588_amd64.deb && sudo apt-get install -f .
```
 
 or 

 ```bash
    sudo apt install ./code_1.27.2-1536736588_amd64.deb
```

* From the GUI, find the deb file that was downloaded, and double-click from the desktop to instantiate the default package manager, typically Synaptic Package Manager for Ubuntu.

Once installed, you should open Visual Studio Code, and see the following screen:
