## 3.2 Github

Github is a web-based hosting service used for version control using Git, primarily for code based projects, but virtually anything can be version controlled on Github, in fact, this book, along with the accompanying code is being managed in Github. Git itself is a version control system developed by Linus Torvalds to manage a distributed team working on the Linux Operating System. Prior to Git, most version control systems were centralized around a common master repository, whereas Git is a peer-to-peer version control system where an equal copy of the repository is accessible to anyone, however, it is usually managed by either an individual or a group, and changes are approved via pull requests from another individuals version repository. 

Github allows for a central storage location of the repository while still maintaining Git's peer-to-peer ethos. Github has become the repository of choice, and is used by many external services to sync, and distribute updated code. Github is more than just a centralized repository though, it's a code base management system as well, allowing functional owners to manage issues, patching, requests for changes, and documentation.
