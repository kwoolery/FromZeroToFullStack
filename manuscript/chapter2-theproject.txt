    - Cons
        - Not everyone likes Trivia
        - Not really a practical Application

        - Highlights most of the functionality that is necessary to build an app
        - Allows for opportunity to interact with a 3rd party app
        - Uses Location Based Services
        - Can be used for different types of business without much work
    - Cons
        - Not really ideal for a real time communication component

* Slot Machine

        - Fun
        - Managing Data that gets shared among users
    - Cons
        - Not practical as a web application, really more focused on client side
