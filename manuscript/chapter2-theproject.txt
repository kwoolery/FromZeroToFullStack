# 2. The Project

The project we're going to be building is a coffee shop ranker application that allows users to sign-up, login, search for coffee shops, read the details of the coffee shop, review the coffee shop itself, review individual menu items, leave comments, post to local classified section, upload images, and initiate chat with others that are currently in the coffee shop. We'll go over each feature in more detail below.  

### Feature Requirements

#### Signup
We need to allow new users to signup in order to create unique identies within our application. We'll do this by allowing them to use either their Facebook, or Google user information. This will require integration with the Facebook and Google identity systems. If a user signs up with Facebook or Google, we'll create an internal record to map our user ID to the connected Facebook or Google ID. In case a user decides not to link their Facebook or Google account, we'll also allow users to signup directly with their email addresses. The signup process will capture basic information, such as age, gender, and their preferences for coffee shops and coffee. 

#### Login
We need to allow users to login with their email, or with either their Facebook or Google credentials. This is a simple interface that presents the user with an input box for their username or email and a password box. Below the input boxes, there will be a button for signing in with Facebook, and another for signing in with Google.
