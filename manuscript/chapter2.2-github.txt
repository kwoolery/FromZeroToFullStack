## 2.2 Github

Github is a web-based hosting service used for version control using Git, primarily for code based projects, but virtually anything can be version controlled on Github, in fact, this book, along with the accompanying code is being managed in Github. Git itself is a version control system developed by Linus Torvalds to manage a distributed team working on the Linux Operating System. Prior to Git, most version control systems were centralized around a common master repository, whereas Git is a peer-to-peer version control system where an equal copy of the repository is accessible to anyone, however, it is usually managed by either an individual or a group, and changes are approved via pull requests from another individuals version repository. If you want to know more about Git, you can check out the appendix for a list of common Git commands.

Github allows for a central storage location of the repository while still maintaining Git's peer-to-peer ethos. Github has become the repository of choice, and is used by many external services to sync, and distribute updated code. Github is more than just a centralized repository though, it's a code base management system as well, allowing functional owners to manage issues, patching, requests for changes, and documentation. 

### Github Setup Instructions
Go to the Github sign up page at <https://github.com/join?source=login>

For the purposes of setting up our project, you should choose the option that enables you to have an unlimited number of public projects. Github is a popular choice for a centralized repository for many open source projects, however, there are times you may want to keep your repository private, in which case, Github provides a paid account type that allows you to choose which repositories are made available to the public. Keep in mind, you, as the account owner, still control access to your public repositories, and can accept or reject pull requests based on your own requirements. Once you choose your plan, click on the Continue button. The final page will allow you to tailor your experience.

You can choose to answer the questions on this page, or skip this page. Some of the answers may allow Github to promote certain features to you in order to make your experience with Github more streamlined, but it's not required to use the service. Once you've completed this form, click the Submit button, or the "skip this step" link.

Once you complete the signup process, you'll end up on the repositories landing page, where you can navigate into your own repositories, or stay up-to-date on the repositories you've starred, or watched.

### Creating a Github Project
From the landing page, click on the "Start a project" button. You'll be presented with the following screen that will guide you in the process of creating a new repository.

{width=85%}
![Start a Project](images/chapter2.2-github/startproject.jpg)

For the project, in this book, go ahead and input "coffeeshopranker" as the Repository name. Keep the public repository option selected. Leave the option to initialize the repository with a README file unselected. Github uses the README file as a landing page for your repository. We'll create, and update this file in a later section when we're importing our project into Visual Studio Code. Click on the "Create repository" button. 

You should be taken to the following repository landing page. 

{width=85%}
![Repository Landing Page](images/chapter2.2-github/poststartproject.jpg)

Congratulations, you've successfully created a project on Github! Now it's time to jump into Visual Studio Code, and start adding files to your repository. 

### Importing Project into Visual Studio code
Open a new Visual Studio Code Window. 

{width=85%}
![Visual Studio Code Welcome Page](images/chapter2.1-vscode/welcome.jpg)

From the top menu bar, select View -> Command Palette, and type 'Git: Clone', then press the 'enter' key. You'll be presented with an input box to enter your repository url. You can find the URL on the Github repository landing page. Make sure HTTPS is selected, and copy the url presented, it should look something similar to the URL for my version of the project.  

<https://github.com/truvukevin/coffeeshopranker.git>

After you press the 'enter' key, you should be presented with a directory selector window. You can choose an existing directory, or create a new directory in the location of your choosing. Call the new directory 'coffeeshopranker' and click the "Select Repository Location" button. 

{width=85%}
![Select a Repository Location](images/chapter2.2-github/selectrepositorylocation.jpg)

If the clone is successful, you'll be asked to open the cloned repository in the bottom right hand corner of Visual Studio Code. Click on the "Open Repository" button to be taken to the project landing sceen. 

{width=85%}

If you see a page similar to this, then congratulations, you've connected your local Visual Studio Code project repository to the remote Github repository! 

You now have a complete standalone version of the project locally, and you'll only sync your repository to the Github version when you explicitly push your changes, which we'll discuss in the next few sections. You can add and remove branches locally without impacting the remote repository, so you should feel safe to experiment locally without impacting the public version of the repository. 

### Creating your first file and syncing on Github 

Click on the add file icon, and name the file README.md. This uses a special type of syntax called Markdown that can be used format the pages for rendering on Github. The README.md file is the file displayed prominently on your Github repository landing page, typically basic documentation, and links to examples go in this section. For now, we'll just create basic placeholder text. 

```
## Coffee Shop Ranker
First commit of README.md file.
```

{width=85%}
![Add README.md](images/chapter2.2-github/readmefile.jpg)

The very basic example above will just format the 'Coffee Shop Ranker' as a header with larger, bold font, while the second line will be formatted as plain text. Please see Appendix D for a Markdown reference.

Once you update the README.md file, you should see a little blue numeric indicator on the Version Control icon in the left sidebar of Visual Studio Code. This number indicates how many files differ from what is currently checked into the active Git branch. 

{width=50%,float=center}
![Master Branch Indicator](images/chapter2.2-github/firstcheckin.jpg)

Clicking on this icon takes you to a list of files that have been changed. If the list looks good, in this case you should see README.md in the list, add a message, and click the checkmark above the message. 

{float=center}
![Master Branch Indicator](images/chapter2.2-github/vs-code-git-checkmark.jpg)

This will save the file in the local master branch, or whichever branch is currently selected. Once the file is saved locally, you should get an indicator on the bottom left corner next to the "master" that indicates that there are changes ready to push up to the remote repository, in this case Github. If you click on the up arrow, the file will be synced to the remote repository.

{float=center}
![Master Branch Indicator](images/chapter2.2-github/vs-code-branch-diff-indicator.jpg)

If there's a problem pushing to github because you get a permission denied error. Try opening up a Terminal from the top menu by clicking on View -> Terminal. You can reset your git remote origin by running the following:

```bash
git remote remove origin

git remote add origin  https://truvukevin@github.com/truvukevin/coffeeshopranker.git
```

Where truvukevin is the username you created the repository with. When you push to the repository, you'll be asked for your password in Visual Studio Code. 

If all is successful, and you navigate to your github repository homepage, you can see the file you just changed has been uploaded, and the markdown has been formatted. You should see something similar to figure <nnn>.

### Making a Mistake and Reverting
Add the following to end of the README.md file.

```
This is a mistake I don't really want. 
```

Save the file, then check the file in to your local repository, and add a message that identifies this change, and push the file to the Github master branch as desribed in the previous section. Verify that the change has been made and is up on Github.

Now, by either right clicking on the file, and choosing Git: View File History, or bringing up the Command Palette and typing Git: View File History, you'll invoke the Visual Studio Code Git History plugin, and you should get a tab with a detailed history of the file in question. 

Find the most recent commit. You'll see a blue button on the righthand side of the commit that has a clipboard icon, a litte circle with two lines coming out, and the first 7 characters of the commit ID. If you click on the middle icon, you'll get a set of choices. You can choose to revert this commit, and go back to the state of file from the previous commit, or you can find the commit in the list you want go to, and revert to a specific version of the file. When you choose to revert, Git History automatically takes care of checking the file in to your local repository, and creating a title called "Revert 'Previous Commit Message'". Once your local repository is up to date, you can push the changes to master, and verify that the mistake is no longer part of the file.
