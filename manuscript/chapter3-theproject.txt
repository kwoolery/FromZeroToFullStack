# 3. The Project

The project we're going to be building is a coffee shop ranker application that allows users to sign-up, login, search for coffee shops, read the details of the coffee shop, review the coffee shop itself, review individual menu items, leave comments, post to local classified section, upload images, and initiate chat with others that are currently in the coffee shop. We'll go over each feature in more detail below. When starting a new project, either on your own, or with a product manager, it's important to map out the direction you're going to take in order to design a viable front and backend architecture. Even if you have hand drawn wireframes with lines connecting the various user facing pages, it'll save time troubleshooting an idea, instead of trying to retrofit functionality in code once the ball has started rolling.
