## 1.2 Motivations

The motiviation behind this book is two-fold. First, as an software engineering leader, I'm faced with developers of varying skillsets and drive. Some are new to the field, and extremely eager to learn, but may not necessarily know where to turn to get a complete picture of the entire software development lifecycle. While others who have been developing software for a while, still struggle to move beyond their current level, perhaps because they perceive new technology as too difficult and time consuming to spend energy learning, and they wouldn't necessarily know where to look to begin. There are the occassional superstars, who transcend us mere mortals, and they find everything they need in a seemingly magical way, but I assure you there is no magic, only concepts that once understood will help you navigate the world of software engineering in a much more efficient way. I want to give all developers who are interested a feeling of confidence that all the information is accessible, and can be achieved without the intimidation, or overwhelming feeling they may have. Second, I want to reiterate that there is no magic, everything that happens in a computer can be traced back to instructions written at a much lower level, you may not understand the results of some complicated algorithm, but you shouldn't be blocked from knowing that you can trace all algorithms back to fundamental building blocks. 

This book is for developers of all levels with an interest in learning, and improving their ability to visualize a path to implementation of a non-trivial application. Even if you are focused primarily on one area of development, by the end of this book, you should have a better understanding about how all the pieces fit together, and how they are synchronized to achieve the end experience.
