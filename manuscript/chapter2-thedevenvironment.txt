# 2. The Development Environment

In order to be efficient as a full stack developer, you must be organized in thought and action, and be a master of your tools. Your development environment should become an extension of your thought process. If you're unfamiliar with your environment, and have to hunt and peck for ways to do things, you'll spend most of your time context switching, and not actually solving the problems at hand. It is your responsibility to be completely comfortable in the environment you're working in, even if it means spending some time familiarizing yourself with new tools. In this project, you'll be presented with an environment, and I'll walk you through the important parts of each tool, however there are times when you may enter a project after it has begun, and you'll be required to use tools that you are unfamiliar with. As important as the actual code is, it is also critical that you are able to use the tools to their fullest potential. It can mean the difference between spending hours tracking an issue with print line debugging, versus using the capabilities of the debugger to find the issue in minutes. What follows is the environment we'll be using for the rest of the book, this includes the Visual Studio Code Editor, Github, TravisCI, AWS, Docker, Go, NodeJS, React, Redux, and Selenium.
